<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  
  Hello! I'm Gaurav Gupta, a second-year BBA student with a passion for digital marketing and IT. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy watching RomCom movies and action-packed anime with great storylines. Some of my favorite anime include One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Demon Slayer, and Attack on Titan.
  
  I love reading business and psychology books, especially those focused on self-development. In the gaming world, I enjoy multiplayer games like PUBG/BGMI, Valorant, and GTA 5.
  
  One of my proudest moments was participating in various dance competitions during school functions and hometown events, even though I didn't win, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 
  
  My long-term goal is to build my own startup and run a successful social media marketing agency. I'm also excited to start content creation soon, focusing on self-improvement and vlogging my travels.
  
  My biggest motivation is my mom, as I aspire to achieve great things for her and find a wonderful life partner. In my free time, I love to hang out outside and unwind by sleeping when I'm tired.
  
  I'm driven by my dreams and the desire to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
